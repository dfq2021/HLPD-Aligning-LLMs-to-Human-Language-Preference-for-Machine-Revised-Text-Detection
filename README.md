# HLPD-Aligning-LLMs-to-Human-Language-Preference-for-Machine-Revised-Text-Detection
 **[AAAI 2026 paper]**


## Abstract
To prevent misinformation and social issues arising from
trustworthy-looking content generated by LLMs, it is cru-
cial to develop efficient and reliable methods for identifying
the source of texts. Previous approaches have demonstrated
exceptional performance in detecting texts fully generated by
LLMs. However, these methods struggle when confronting
more advanced LLM output or text with adversarial multi-task
machine revision, especially in the black-box setting, where
the generating model is unknown. To address this challenge,
grounded in the hypothesis that human writing possesses dis-
tinctive stylistic patterns, we propose Human Language Pref-
erence Detection (HLPD). HLPD employs a reward-based
alignment process, Human Language Preference Optimization
(HLPO), to shift the scoring model’s token distribution toward
human-like writing, making the model more sensitive to hu-
man writing, therefore enhancing the identification of machine-
revised text. We test HLPD in an adversarial multi-task eval-
uation framework that leverages a five- dimensional prompt
generator and multiple advanced LLMs to create diverse re-
vision scenarios. When detecting texts revised by GPT-series
models, HLPD achieves a 15.11% relative improvement in
AUROC over ImBD, surpassing Fast-DetectGPT by 45.56%.
When evaluated on texts generated by advanced LLMs, HLPD
achieves the highest average AUROC, exceeding ImBD by
5.53% and Fast-DetectGPT by 34.14%
